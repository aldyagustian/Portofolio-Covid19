## Data Analyst Portofolio using Microsoft SQL Server (SSMS) and Tableau.


#### Flow for this Portofolio:
1. Collect and Explore the data *(using SQL Server)*
2. Cleaning the data *(using SQL Server)*
3. Define the problem 
4. Data Visualization *(using Tableau)*

---

#### What I'm trying to analyze from this data is:
1. Total Cases vs Total Deaths
2. Total Cases vs Population
3. Shows what percentage of population infected with Covid-19
4. Countries with Highest Infection Rate compared to Population
5. Countries with Highest Death Count compared to Population
6. Showing contintents with the highest death
7. The **Global Numbers** *(total Infections, world's population, perent of people infected)* 
8. Shows Percentage of Population that has recieved at least one Covid-19 Vaccine

---

#### What functions that I used in SQL:
1. Group by
2. Order by
3. Joins
4. Aggregate Functions
5. Converting Data Types
6. Windows Functions
7. Temp Table

---

#### For the Data Visualization Dashboard I'm showing:
1. Covid Dashboard
- Global Numbers
- Total Death per Continent
- Percent population infected by Country
- Highest Infection Per Country
2. Global Vaccinations Tracker
- Interactive Dashboard (you can choose the date and the country)
- How many people has been partly or fully vaccinated
- Fully vaccinated over population VS Partially vaccinated over population
- % people with at least one dose vaccinations per Country
- How does GDP per capita effect vaccinations?

1. Data sources
- [Covid-19 Deaths](../blob/main/CovidDeaths.xlsx)
- [Covid-19 Vaccinations](../blob/main/CovidVaccinations.xlsx)
2. Actual Script SQL
- [Data Exploration](../blob/main/DataExploration.sql)
- [Queries for Tableau](../blob/main/Queries%20used%20for%20Tableau%20Covid%20Dashboard.sql)
3. Data Visualization

> Through data analysis and visualization, we can gain valuable insights into the Covid-19 pandemic, including the total number of infections worldwide, as well as identifying the countries that have been most severely impacted by the virus, in terms of both deaths and infections. We can also use data analysis to identify countries with low vaccination rates and assess the potential risks associated with this. Overall, data analysis and visualization provide us with critical tools to understand the impact of Covid-19 and make informed decisions about how best to respond to this ongoing global health crisis.
