## Analysis of COVID-19 Cases and Vaccinations by Country using Microsoft SQL Server (SSMS) and Tableau.


#### Project Overview:
This project aims to collect, explore, clean, analyze, and visualize COVID-19 data using SQL Server and Tableau. The project will focus on the total cases vs total deaths, total cases vs population, percentage of population infected with COVID-19, countries with the highest infection rate and death count compared to the population, continents with the highest death count, global numbers, and percentage of population that has received at least one COVID-19 vaccine. The project will create an interactive dashboard that tracks global vaccinations, shows the percentage of population that has received at least one COVID-19 vaccine, and examines the effect of GDP per capita on vaccinations.

#### Project Flow:
1. Collect and explore COVID-19 data using *SQL Server*.
2. Clean the data by handling missing values, and correcting data types.
3. Define the problem by identifying the key questions and objectives of the analysis.
4. Analyze the data using SQL functions such as:
- Group by
- Order by
- Joins
- Aggregate functions
- Converting data types
- Windows functions
- Temp table
5. Visualize the data using Tableau by creating interactive dashboards and charts.

#### Project Deliverables:

1. A report summarizing the key findings and insights from the analysis.
2. Interactive dashboards and charts showing the COVID-19 data analysis and visualization.
3. SQL scripts used for cleaning, analyzing, and manipulating the data.
4. Tableau workbooks and visualizations.

---

#### Expected Outcomes:
1. Gain insights into the total cases vs total deaths
2. Total cases vs population
3. Percentage of population infected with Covid-19
4. Countries with the highest infection rate and death count compared to the population
5. Continents with the highest death count
6. Global numbers
7. % of population that has received at least one COVID-19 vaccine
8. Visualize the data in an interactive dashboard **(Global Vaccinations Tracker)** that allows users to explore and interact with the data.

#### For the Data Visualization Dashboard I'm showing:
1. Covid Dashboard
- Global Numbers
- Total Death per Continent
- Percent population infected by Country
- Highest Infection Per Country
2. Global Vaccinations Tracker
- Interactive Dashboard (you can choose the date and the country)
- How many people has been partly or fully vaccinated
- Fully vaccinated over population VS Partially vaccinated over population
- % people with at least one dose vaccinations per Country
- How does GDP per capita effect vaccinations?

> Through data analysis and visualization, we can gain valuable insights into the Covid-19 pandemic, including the total number of infections worldwide, as well as identifying the countries that have been most severely impacted by the virus, in terms of both deaths and infections. We can also use data analysis to identify countries with low vaccination rates and assess the potential risks associated with this. Overall, data analysis and visualization provide us with critical tools to understand the impact of Covid-19 and make informed decisions about how best to respond to this ongoing global health crisis.
