#Data Analyst Portofolio using Microsoft SQL Server (SSMS) and Tableau.

####Flow for this Portofolio:
  - Collect and Explore the data *(using SQL Server)*
  - Cleaning the data *(using SQL Server)*
  - Define the problem 
  - Data Visualization *(using Tableau)*

---

####What I'm trying to analyze from this data is:
  - Total Cases vs Total Deaths
  - Total Cases vs Population
  - Shows what percentage of population infected with Covid-19
  - Countries with Highest Infection Rate compared to Population
  - Countries with Highest Death Count compared to Population
  - Showing contintents with the highest death
  - The **Global Numbers** *(total Infections, world's population, perent of people infected)* 
  - Shows Percentage of Population that has recieved at least one Covid-19 Vaccine

---

####What functions that I used in SQL:
  - Group by
  - Order by
  - Joins
  - Aggregate Functions
  - Converting Data Types
  - Windows Functions
  - Temp Table

---

####For the Data Visualization Dashboard I'm showing:
  **1. Covid Dashboard**
      - **Global Numbers**
      - Total Death per Continent
      - Percent population infected by Country
    - Highest Infection Per Country
  **2. Global Vaccinations Tracker**
      - **Interactive Dashboard (you can choose the date and the country)**
      - How many people has been partly or fully vaccinated
      - Fully vaccinated over population VS Partially vaccinated over population
      - % people with at least one dose vaccinations per Country
      - How does GDP per capita effect vaccinations?
