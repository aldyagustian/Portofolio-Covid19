Data Analyst Portofolio using Microsoft SQL Server (SSMS) and Tableau.

Flow for this Portofolio:
  - Collect and Explore the data
  - Cleaning the data
  - Define the problem  
  - Data Visualization
  
What I'm trying to analyze from this data is:
  - Total Cases vs Total Deaths
  - Total Cases vs Population
  - Shows what percentage of population infected with Covid
  - Countries with Highest Infection Rate compared to Population
  - Countries with Highest Death Count per Population
  - Showing contintents with the highest death count per population
  - The GLOBAL NUMBERS
  - Total Population vs Vaccinations
  - Shows Percentage of Population that has recieved at least one Covid Vaccine

What functions that I used in SQL:
  - Group by
  - Order by
  - Joins
  - Aggregate Functions
  - Creating Views
  - Converting Data Types
  - Windows Functions

For the Data Visualization Dashboard I'm showing:
1. Covid Dashboard
  - Lowest Vaccinations compare to population by Country
  - Global Numbers
  - Percent population infected by Country
  - Total Death per Continent

2. Global Vaccinations Tracker
  - Interactive Dashboard (you can choose the date and the country)
  - How many people has been partly or fully vaccinated
  - Fully vaccinated over population VS Partially vaccinated over population
  - Percentage people with at least one dose vaccinations per Country
  - How does GDP per capita effect vaccinations?
